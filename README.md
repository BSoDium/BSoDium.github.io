This repository contains the source code of my eportfolio, a react app which showcases my skills and projects. I used MUI Joy for UI components and DALL-E 3 for illustrations. You can visit the website at https://bsodium.fr.

See the [License](#license) section for more information on how to use the code.

## Installation

To run the app locally, you need to have Node.js and yarn installed on your machine. Clone this repository and run the following commands in the root directory:

```bash
yarn install # install dependencies
yarn start # start development server
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.
