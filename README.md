This repository contains the source code of my eportfolio, which is a react app that showcases my skills and projects. I used MUI Joy for UI components and Bing Image Creator powered by DALL-E for illustrations. You can visit the website at https://bsodium.fr.

## Installation

To run the app locally, you need to have Node.js and yarn installed on your machine. Then, clone this repository and run the following commands in the root directory:

```bash
yarn install # install dependencies
yarn start # start development server
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.
